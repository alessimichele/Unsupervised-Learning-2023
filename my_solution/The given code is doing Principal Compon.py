The given code is doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Dry Bean Dataset using python. PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the features into a lower-dimensional space while still retaining the maximum possible amount of variation present in the data. The refactored code will follow the same steps but with some modifications to improve the code's clarity and efficiency. The following is the refactored code with explanations:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# 1. Load the dataset
df = pd.read_excel("../Datasets/Dry_Bean_Dataset.xlsx")

# 2. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop(columns=['Class']).values
y = df['Class'].values

# 3. Standardize the dataset
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_std = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# 4. Calculate the covariance matrix
cov_mat = np.cov(X_std.T)

# 5. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)

# 6. Sort the eigenvectors in descending order
sorted_indices = np.argsort(eig_vals)[::-1]
sorted_eigvecs = eig_vecs[:,sorted_indices]

# 7. Choose the top k eigenvectors based on the explained variance
num_features = X_std.shape[1]
explained_variance_ratio = eig_vals / np.sum(eig_vals)
cumulative_variance_ratio = np.cumsum(explained_variance_ratio)
num_components = 2 # choose the number of components
top_k_eigvecs = sorted_eigvecs[:,:num_components]

# 8. Transform the dataset into the new subspace
X_pca = X_std.dot(top_k_eigvecs)

```

Changes:
1. Instead of using ".loc" to get the features (X) and target (y), we used ".drop" for features and ".values" to convert the dataframe into numpy arrays, which are more compatible with the preprocessing and dimensionality reduction libraries.
2. We also changed the variables' names to make them more descriptive and understandable.
3. We sorted the eigenvectors in descending order to make sure that the top transformers contribute most to the variance.
4. We converted the eigenvectors representation matrices to the matrix of the required dimensions with the most variance explained.
5. We removed some unnecessary variables and optimized the code's performance by using numpy functions.
